## Personal Introduction
Hey, I'm **Alex Boyd.**
I'm interested in learning Python to create computational fluid dynamic models to help in my chemical engineering career.
I'm currently learning about using Git-Hub as this is my first version control programming experience.
I'm probably not worth collaborating with at this time.
